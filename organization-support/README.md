New data-driven businesses are mushrooming, organizations across industries are embracing technological advancements, and cyber criminals are getting more sophisticated. Cyber crime rates are growing, and with further growth of such crimes expected. With that in mind it is prominent that you enroll in a bug bounty platform as an organization.

An organization that has sensitive information to guard and no internal staff to find security bugs (vulnerabilities), they can use Bug Zero to hire InfoSec professionals and only pay for what they find.

For organizations, Bug Zero provides;

* Security testing for no upfront capital investment.
* Security testing for no staffing or fixed budget constraints.
* A diverse set of eyes on your system with zero recruitment or other logistical overhead.
* Increased visibility and transparency for your system.

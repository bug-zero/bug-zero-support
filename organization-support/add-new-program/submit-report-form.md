# Submit Report Form



Report form specify how the hackers should structure the description and the impact in their reports. It help to ensure that hackers provide you with all of the information you need to verify and validate the report.

Instead of the report submission form being an empty white box where the hacker has to remember to submit the right details, a structured report form can guide the hackers to submit only necessary details you needed.

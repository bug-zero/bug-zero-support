# Disclosure

Disclosure allows you to be transparent about the security flaws discovered in your program. BugZero's disclosure procedure maintains a balance between transparency and control over what information is made public. Any closed report in your program can be requested by the hacker. If the administrator of your program agrees to disclosure, the report's contents will be made public.

### Requesting Disclosure <a href="#requesting-disclosure" id="requesting-disclosure"></a>

After report have been closed:

1. Go to the bottom of the report above the comment box.
2. Select **Request** **Disclosure** in the action picker.
3. Select whether you want to disclose the whole document or part of it,

| State   | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full    | <p>With full disclosure, all the contents of the report will be publicly visible including:</p><ul><li>Information about vulnerability</li><li>Summary</li><li>Timeline (this includes comments and attachments)</li></ul> |
| Summary | Only the activity summary and timeline are displayed. All comments and attachments have been hidden. Limited disclosure gives you more control over sensitive or irrelevant information.                                   |

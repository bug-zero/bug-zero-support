### Invitee Launch <a href="#public-launch" id="public-launch"></a>

If your program is approved by Bugzero, it will be placed in **Invitee launch** where it'll remain private and visible to only a select number of hackers. Within the Invitee launch stage, you can invite hackers to your program and manage the reports you receive.

### Limited Launch <a href="#public-launch" id="public-launch"></a>

The program is only available for 10% of Bug Zero hackers.

### Public Launch <a href="#public-launch" id="public-launch"></a>

Once you've met the criteria in Invitee Launch, the **Public launch** button will appear, and you can publicly self-launch your program whenever you're ready to. When you publicly launch your program, your vulnerability disclosure program will be published on Bugzero's Directory and will be open to other hackers to submit reports.

A bug bounty program is a crowd-sourcing initiative that allows an individual to earn rewards by discovering and reporting software bugs or vulnerabilities with potential to be exploited. Most organizations who often search for services through a bug bounty program are looking to perform internal code audits and pen-tests to analyze the organizationâ€™s vulnerability management plans and strategies.

Ethical hackers can support you in detecting vulnerabilities in your business before the bad guys find your weaknesses, running a bug bounty program is a smart way to find software or configuration errors that hide from developers and security teams before they lead to a massive fallout.

The submitted bug reports by the hacker usually includes enough information for the organization (the one paying the payout amount) to able to reproduce the scenario where the vulnerability will be showing.

#### 2. Program launch <a href="#2-program-launch" id="2-program-launch"></a>

The company publishes the brief on the chosen bounty page.

#### 3. Start of the program <a href="#3-start-of-the-program" id="3-start-of-the-program"></a>

### Advantages of Bug Bounty Programs <a href="#advantages-of-bug-bounty-programs" id="advantages-of-bug-bounty-programs"></a>

* Bug bounties are open for continuous testing. Each time you make a change or add new functionality, it will be evaluated without having to sign up or wait for your next penetration test. This allows you to constantly have an up-to-date understanding of your risk.
* If your organization signs up for a bug bounty program, you will likely have several experts in specific vulnerabilities evaluating your application/network since bug bounty hunters are paid not for the amount of work they do, but rather for the vulnerabilities they discover.
* You will have 1000s of testers evaluating your program. With more testers there is more of a chance to explore every vulnerability and it will multiply the potential manpower of traditional security assessment methods.
* Companies with traditional testing methods usually have to pay for the effort required for testing while ignoring whatever the results were found. But bug bounties utilize a pay for results model, ensuring that only valid results are paid rather than effort.
* Creates a culture that is more open towards information security practices.
